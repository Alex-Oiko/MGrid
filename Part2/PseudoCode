Assumptions
============
-The Grid will run the mapFunction again if an error exists(i.e. interrupt at the time of run time) for some reason
-The file handling is so super duper high level that I can get the list from it just by using  fileContets.getList
-gridSubmit returns the jobID of the job it just submitted
